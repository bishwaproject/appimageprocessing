# appimageprocessing
### Objective:
To demonstrate multi-threading concepts by building useful app [ImageProcessing App]

Concepts:
1. Thread Creation:
2. Thread Synchronization
3. Thread Pooling
4. Thread Communication
5. Thread Interruption
6. Thread Safety in Shared Data

By applying these concept, we can provider faster results and a smoother user experience.
Itâ€™s generally a good practice to organize your code into separate classes based on their responsibilities and functionality. This helps in code maintenance, reusability, and readability. 

#### structure of classes

1. Main Class: This class serves as the entry point of the application. It can handle initialization, user input, and manage the overall flow of the program.
2. ImageProcessingApp Class: This class represents the image processing application itself. It contains methods for loading images, applying filters, displaying the GUI, and handling user interactions. It can also manage the multi threading aspects of image processing.
3. ImageProcessor class: this class encapsulates the logic for processing individual images. ImageProcessor class implements runnable interface.  It can have methods for applying different filters or transformations to an image. The ImageProcessor class can be used by the ImageProcessingApp class to process images concurrently using multiple threads.

#### some notes
In this. Project, the GUI is created using Swing components.
When the user clicks the "Upload Image" button, a file chooser dialog is displayed. Once the user selects an image file, it is passed to the processImage method, where the image processing logic is applied, and the processed image is saved.The output is displayed in the outputTextArea component.

##### benefits of multi-threading in this app
If there were no threading system in Java, the image processing would be done sequentially in a single thread. Each image would be processed one after another, potentially leading to longer processing times, especially when dealing with multiple images or computationally intensive operations.

By utilizing multiple threads, the processing workload can be divided among the available processor cores, allowing for parallel execution of the image processing tasks. This can significantly improve the overall processing speed and efficiency, especially on systems with multiple processor cores or CPUs.
In summary, multi-threading in Java allows for concurrent execution of tasks, enabling better utilization of system resources and improved performance for computationally intensive or time-consuming operations.

In Java we can perform threading operations by either implementing the Runnable interface or extending the Thread class. Both approaches allow you to create and work with threads.
#### Multi-threading in Spring Boot
Spring Boot integrates with the Java ExecutorService and ThreadPoolExecutor classes, which are part of the java.util.concurrent package. These classes provide a high-level API for managing and executing tasks in a multithreaded environment.

Spring Boot offers convenient annotations and abstractions to configure and manage multithreading in a Spring application. For example, you can use the @Async annotation to mark methods that should be executed asynchronously. Spring Boot will automatically create and manage the thread pool for executing these asynchronous methods.

Additionally, Spring Boot provides features like TaskExecutor and ThreadPoolTaskExecutor that allow fine-grained control over the thread pool configuration, such as setting the core pool size, maximum pool size, and queue capacity.
